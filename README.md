## Description
ExtJS Spyglass is a powerful Chrome extension designed to enhance the development experience for Sencha Ext JS developers. This extension acts as a sophisticated toolset that enables developers to inspect, navigate, and understand their Ext JS applications more effectively. Just like a spyglass reveals hidden details, ExtJS Spyglass empowers developers to gain deep insights into their Ext JS components, configurations, and interactions, ultimately leading to more efficient development and debugging.

## Features

- **Component Tree Navigation:** Visualize the hierarchical structure of Ext JS components within the application, making it easy to traverse and understand the component hierarchy.

- **Component Details:** Access detailed information about selected components, including their xtype, configuration properties, and event listeners.

- **Property Inspection and Modification:** Inspect and, in certain cases, modify component properties in real-time, facilitating dynamic debugging and testing.

- **State Inspection:** Observe and analyze the internal state of components, offering a clearer view of data flow within the application.

- **Event Inspection:** Track and display events triggered on components, facilitating the understanding of user interactions and event-driven behaviors.

- **Theme Inspection:** Inspect applied styles and themes for components, ensuring consistency and adherence to the application's design.

- **Code Highlighting:** View the source code of selected components, aiding developers in understanding component implementation and facilitating debugging.

- **Performance Profiling:** Analyze and identify potential performance bottlenecks in the Ext JS application, ensuring optimal application responsiveness.

- **Error Reporting:** Receive real-time error information when components encounter exceptions, enabling swift identification and resolution of issues.

- **Time Travel Debugging:** Implement time-travel debugging to replay and inspect the state and UI changes at different points in time, streamlining debugging processes.
